However, in the hyper-competitive FMCG market, the speed at which consumer preferences shift is accelerating. To maintain its leadership, they needed to reimagine the product innovation workflow. Partnering with Tezign, they built the "AI Innovator"—an intelligent, end-to-end system that integrates real-time market insights with generative creative execution. This initiative aims to dissolve the traditional barriers between R&D, marketing, and design, leveraging AI to transform massive, abstract consumer data into concrete, visualized product concepts.' },

Product managers often struggle to articulate new concepts, leading to time-consuming conceptualization phases.' },
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Crucially, a significant gap exists between the "Insight" and "Design" phases. Creative briefs are often subjective, and the transition from a concept to a tangible package design lacks objective data support.

The core struggle was balancing "Precision" (creating what the market data says it wants) with "Creativity" (creating something that stands out emotionally).

        { type: 'paragraph', text: '1. “大水漫灌”的失效：传统的高举高打式广告投放难以触达细分圈层，ROI 持续走低。品牌急需将庞大的经销商和员工网络转化为活跃的社交媒体声量节点，但缺乏有效的工具。' },
        { type: 'paragraph', text: '2. “想做但不会做”的能力断层：成千上万的经销商和一线销售精通卖酒，但缺乏短视频拍摄、文案撰写和热点捕捉的专业能力。内容生产的高门槛导致了“哑巴营销”，一线人员有心无力。' },
        { type: 'paragraph', text: '3. 合规与管控的死结：白酒行业广告法规严格，如何确保数万个分散账号发布的内容既具创意又不违规？依赖人工审核不仅效率低下，成本更是天文数字。品牌需要在“放得开”（鼓励创作）与“管得住”（确保安全）之间找到平衡。' },

        { type: 'paragraph', text: '2. 原子化的创意赋能：通过“查找/学习爆文内容”和“调整文案/图片/视频”模块，AI 能够自动生成朋友圈文案、短视频分镜脚本。用户既可以“按照模板”快速仿写，也可以“自主创作”，AI 负责填补能力缺口，让创意从 0 到 1 变为从 0.8 到 1。' },
