      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'In the trajectory of enterprise AI application, we are witnessing a significant paradigm shift: the focus is moving from point solutions for "content generation" to systematic "task execution." Enterprises no longer settle for AI as merely a creative Copilot; they expect it to evolve into an Agent capable of understanding complex business objectives, planning paths, and being accountable for final outcomes. However, in real-world commercial environments, this leap faces immense challenges: business goals are often ambiguous, unstructured intents; decision-making relies on highly implicit enterprise context; and execution must adhere to strict security and compliance boundaries.' },

GEA strives to understand the Outcome the enterprise truly aims to achieve (e.g., "increase click-through rates" or "align with new seasonal brand tonality"). It translates ambiguous business goals into computable constraints.' },

      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Problems faced by enterprises are mostly open-ended—with ambiguous goals, complex constraints, and non-unique paths. While generic reasoning models often seek standard answers, Tezign\'s proprietary Creative Reasoning Model focuses on handling this high uncertainty.' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The model possesses a unique divergence and convergence mechanism: under a given business Intent, it can simultaneously generate multiple feasible hypotheses and action plans. Subsequently, it conducts comparative reasoning by combining historical enterprise content, decision records, and exceptions to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of different scenarios. Crucially, it has evolutionary capabilities, continuously filtering out ineffective paths through execution feedback while retaining and reinforcing strategies that prove effective within the specific enterprise context.' },

In enterprises, vast amounts of experience exist in unstructured forms within individual memories and scattered documents. The Context Graph is the core cognitive structure in the GEA system designed to organize, connect, and evolve this implicit cognition.' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Going beyond simple knowledge graphs, it systematically connects the dynamic relationships between content, behavior, decisions, rules, and outcomes. Starting with data precipitated in DAM, the Context Graph continuously builds evolutionary associations between content pieces, mappings between content and business goals/scenarios, and causal feedback between decisions and results. This allows an enterprise\'s "experience" to be structured into a cognitive network that agents can query, understand, and continuously learn from in real-time.' },

This design achieves a thorough decoupling of reasoning and execution, endowing agents with extreme flexibility and extensibility. Enterprises can assemble different Skills like building blocks, allowing GEA to no longer rely on hard-coded logic but to form an executable system that is composable, evolutionary, and scalable.' },

Unlike personal AI assistants, enterprise agents process core trade secrets and private data. Tezign has established Data Sovereignty as a supreme principle from the very beginning of its architectural design.' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'We adopt an architectural design that strictly separates "Model Capabilities" from "Client Data." Client private data (including content assets, operational data, and context graphs) always belongs to the client, is stored in independent isolated environments, and is never used to train generic foundation models. Enterprise Context is accessed by specific agent instances only within the scope explicitly authorized by the client, and is incinerated after use or stored encrypted on demand. This design ensures physically and logically that enterprises do not face the risk of core asset leakage while gaining AI capabilities.' },

Tezign has built a compliance system aligned with major international enterprise AI standards. Throughout the product design, R&D process, and operations lifecycle, we strictly adhere to SOC 2 (Type II) requirements regarding security, availability, and data integrity, and have established an information security management system compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 standards.' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'For globally operating enterprises, the GEA system has built-in mechanisms compliant with regional data protection regulations such as GDPR, supporting data minimization, user rights response, and cross-border data transfer compliance. This means that every inference and decision made by the agent runs within an auditable and traceable compliance framework, providing solid legal and security assurance for AI applications across different jurisdictions.' },
      { type: 'heading', text: 'On-Premise & Hybrid Deployment: Infrastructure Autonomy' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'For finance, government, and large conglomerates, absolute control over data is paramount. The GEA architecture naturally supports flexible deployment forms, including On-Premise and hybrid cloud models.' },
      { type: 'paragraph', text: 'In the on-premise deployment mode, core enterprise data, Context Graphs, and DAM assets can run entirely within the client\'s own private cloud or local data center, physically isolated from external public networks. Simultaneously, GEA supports decoupled deployment of model capabilities; enterprises can choose to run the reasoning layer locally or call privately deployed large model instances via secure dedicated lines. This architecture not only eliminates the risk of data leaving the domain but also ensures that enterprise agents can truly integrate into the enterprise\'s long-term IT infrastructure, becoming a sustainable, evolving, and autonomous AI infrastructure rather than a black-box tool controlled by external vendors.' }
